# Project Title

Sonic: Unreal Adventures is just a fan-game made from the ground up by [@PhantomDevIndie](https://github.com/AstroGamesIndie), expect it to break, since it's my first full-on game, plus it's open-source (how could you be reading if it wasn't) so you can fix it yourself, if you know how to, if you are gonna re-use my code, I don't know why you would but I don't judge, just give credit since I put A TON of work in this project.
